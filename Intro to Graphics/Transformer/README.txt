Tranformation of primitives
Assignment 3 - Transformer

Translation, Rotation, and Scaling about the world axes work.
Reset works.
Keys 1-4 are shapes and 0 is the house.
 The house has no controls. I didn't have time to add it as an actual shape.
Camera controls work properly.

Revolving on mouse click:
 The shape with revolve around its Y axis with no problems if translated anywhere.
 If it is rotated it does not work, it has to be something simple I'm missing but
  i'm just not sure anymore.

EC:
I added a head bob for when increasing or decreasing camera location by Z.
 There is also a floor you can toggle on and off with 'D' to make the head bob look better.
