Known bugs (if any): If you are holding 'a' or 'd' to move the shapes you cannot click to create shapes. It's a glut thing I dont
 know how to fix or have the time to. But this doesn't effect the non extra credit part.

Extra credit (describe what you did, if any): Pressing 'a' and 'd' move the shapes left or right if they are still bouncing.
 The longer you hold in the faster they go.

Comments: Works on lab machines and 5502 machines.
