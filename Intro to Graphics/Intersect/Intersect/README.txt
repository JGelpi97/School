Project 5 - Intersect
VS 2012 - Windows 8/7

Since the project description is pretty ambiguous about controls and everything else, here are the controls:
Change render mode(particularly useful) - '\'

Camera:
Forward/Back 		- W/S
Strafe Left/Right 	- A/D
Go Up/Down 			- R/F
Look Left/Right		- Mouse

Cone:
Forward/Back 		- I/K
Go Up/Down 			- U/H
Turn Left/Right		- J/K

The ray is always drawn following the cone's u axis.
The controls are mostly terrible sorry about that.

Intersections work completely on the sphere and cube with intersection points showing.
Cones and cylinders don't work. I could probably get them working since once I finally figured out what I was actually
 doing with the sphere and cube it was easy.  But the project is already late enough so im turning it in.
 
The spec file specTest.txt is just a randomly placed/rotated/scaled cube and sphere to easily test my intersections.
specRobot is just the regular robot.

EC: Mouse movement for camera
